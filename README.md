I am a recent graduate with a passion for technology, and I am eager to transition into cybersecurity. I am driven by solving complex problems and continuously learning new skills to protect and secure digital systems.

## Objective
As a recent graduate with a passion for technology, I am eager to transition into cybersecurity, with a specific interest in learning and growing within a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. I am committed to enhancing my technical skills and gaining hands-on experience in cybersecurity to contribute to protecting digital infrastructure.

## Skills
Currently building foundational knowledge in cybersecurity. Eager to learn and develop skills in areas such as:
- Network Security
- Incident Response
- Threat Detection
- Vulnerability Management
- Cybersecurity Tools (e.g., SIEM, Firewalls, Endpoint Protection)

## Tools
As I am just starting my journey into cybersecurity, I am in the process of familiarizing myself with various cybersecurity tools. I am focused on learning:
- Basic Network Monitoring Tools
- Introduction to Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) systems
- Endpoint Protection Software

### Tools Iâ€™m Exploring
